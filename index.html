    <p>
      There are multiple types of depression, each with their own range of severity:
      <ul>

        <li>Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly known as dysthymia)</li>
        <li>Major Depression (also known as clinical depression)</li>
        <li>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (unique to anyone with a typical set of female reproductive organs)</li>
        <li>Bipolar Disorder (the really low end meets the criteria for Major Depression)</li>

      </ul>

    </p>
    <p1>
      Each type of depression has their own diagnosis, but common symptoms of these types of depression include:
      <ul>

        <li>Sleep: too little or too much, restless sleep</li>
        <li>Lack of concentration, suicidal thoughts, fatigue</li>
        <li>Behaviorally: Excessive crying, irritability, agitation, social isolation</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite, such as loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Rumination (repeatedly going over negative thoughts of one's distress)</li>

      </ul>
